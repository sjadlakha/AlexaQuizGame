// Is there any free API for multiple choice questions in which we can select categories of competitive exams?

// I am building Alexa skill in which I need question answer API which gives me lots of questions with multiple choices and with their correct answers in JSON format and if an explanation is available of correct answers then it would be great. Competitive exams question answer must be needed. I found apis like https://opentdb.com/api_config.php and http://jservice.io/ but these apis not satisfied my requirements. So if anyone knows any other apis regarding the question and answers then please mention those apis here.
